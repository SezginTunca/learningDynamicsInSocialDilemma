## General Introduction


Social dilemmas in populations are unavoidable. Different interests as different strategies of participants lead
to complex behavior structures. International conflicts, as an example, can be modeled as a social dilemma model.
Thus, international conflicts could be better understood as possibliy better solved trough having an adequate model. 
This has been already done and lead to better understanding why international cooperation might not have succeed.

But learning dynamics are not only interesting for models which represent real life problems but also for research of 
more "intelligent" roboters. There is obviously still a huge potential in learning dynamics research.


(real world example)

## The Model

One assumes a population which is in one of the following social dilemmas: Chicken- or Stage Hunt-Dilemma.
They base their decisions on individual learning process (experimental induction) which can be influenced by their nearest neighbourhood.
it should be possible to vary the payments and set the initial aspirations of the individuum and it's time dependancy. One can also imagine a local regulation, what would reflect an influence of the governement.
With the cellular automata it is possible to perform a sort of peer pressure (the influence of the nearest neighbourhood on the individuum's decision).




## Fundamental Questions

How does competitivenes effect the process of learning?
How much advantages can an actor obtain trough learning?
Which learning strategies are effective, which are not?
Will the learning effect improve trough more complex strategies?
Is it possible to reach, with learning processes, a stable state which differs from the Nash-Equilibrium? 
How do varying payments & expectation thresholds effect them?



## Expected Results

-Intelligent learning leads to improved outcome for the individual actor. 
-Through competitiveness, faster change of behavior is reached.
