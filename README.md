> * Project Title: Learning & neighbourhood effect behaviour of a population in a social dilemma

## General Introduction


Social dilemmas in populations are unavoidable. Different interests as different strategies of participants lead
to complex behavior structures. International conflicts, as an example, can be modeled as a social dilemma model.
Thus, international conflicts could be better understood as possibliy better solved trough having an adequate model. 
This has been already done and lead to better understanding why international cooperation might not have succeed.

But learning dynamics are not only interesting for models which represent real life problems but also for research of 
more "intelligent" roboters. There is obviously still a huge potential in learning dynamics research.


%(States your motivation clearly: why is it important / interesting to solve this problem?)
%(Add real-world examples, if any)
%(Put the problem into a historical context, from what does it originate? Are there already some proposed solutions?)

## The Model

%* social dilemmas: Chicken-/ Stage Hunt-/ Prisoners-Dilemma
%variable payments
%a mix of expectations (verschiedene soziale Schichten)
%noise: deflective agents (max of expectation)
%Learning: predictions of players based on experiential induction
%Near neighbourhood: "Social pressure to behave homogenous"
%Local Input (governement rules) -> Cooperation&high expectations; eventually periodic
(Define dependent and independent variables you want to study. Say how you want to measure them.) (Why is your model a good abtraction of the problem you want to study?) (Are you capturing all the relevant aspects of the problem?)


## Fundamental Questions

%-Which advantages can an actor obtain trough learning?
%-Which learning strategies are effective, which are not?
%-Will the learning effect improve trough more complex strategies?

%(At the end of the project you want to find the answer to these questions)
%(Formulate a few, clear questions. Articulate them in sub-questions, from the more general to the more specific. )
