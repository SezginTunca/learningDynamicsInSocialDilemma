> * Project Title: Ineractiv Learning dynamics in a social dilemma

## General Introduction


Social dilemmas in populations are unavoidable. Different interests as different strategies of participants lead
to complex behavior structures. International conflicts, as an example, can be modeled as a social dilemma model.
Thus, international conflicts could be better understood as possibliy better solved trough having an adequate model. 
This has been already done and lead to better understanding why international cooperation might not have succeed.

But learning dynamics are not only interesting for models which represent real life problems but also for research of 
more "intelligent" roboters. There is obviously still a huge potential in learning dynamics research.


(real world example)

## The Model

One assumes a population which is in one of the following social dilemmas: Chicken-/ Stage Hunt- or Prisoners-Dilemma.
They base their decisions on individual learning process (experimental induction) which can be influenced by their nearest neighbourhood.
it should be possible to vary the payments and set the initial expectations of the individuum and it's time dependancy. One can also imagine a local regulation, what would reflect an influence of the governement.
With the cellular automata it is possible to perform a sort of peer pressure (the influence of the nearest neighbourhood on the individuum's decision).


%Learning: predictions of players based on experimential induction
%Near neighbourhood: "Social pressure to behave homogenous"
%Local Input (governement rules) -> Cooperation&high expectations; eventually periodic


## Fundamental Questions

%-Which advantages can an actor obtain trough learning?
%-Which learning strategies are effective, which are not?
%-Will the learning effect improve trough more complex strategies?

%(At the end of the project you want to find the answer to these questions)
%(Formulate a few, clear questions. Articulate them in sub-questions, from the more general to the more specific. )
