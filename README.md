## General Introduction

%Böh no überlegä
%
%
(States your motivation clearly: why is it important / interesting to solve this problem?)
(Add real-world examples, if any)
(Put the problem into a historical context, from what does it originate? Are there already some proposed solutions?)

## The Model

%* social dilemmas: Chicken-/ Stage Hunt-/ Prisoners-Dilemma
%variable payments
%a mix of expectations (verschiedene soziale Schichten)
%noise: deflective agents (max of expectation)
%Learning: predictions of players based on experiential induction
%Near neighbourhood: "Social pressure to behave homogenous"
%Local Input (governement rules) -> Cooperation&high expectations; eventually periodic
(Define dependent and independent variables you want to study. Say how you want to measure them.) (Why is your model a good abtraction of the problem you want to study?) (Are you capturing all the relevant aspects of the problem?)


## Fundamental Questions

(At the end of the project you want to find the answer to these questions)
(Formulate a few, clear questions. Articulate them in sub-questions, from the more general to the more specific. )


## Expected Results

(What are the answers to the above questions that you expect to find before starting your research?)


## References 

(Add the bibliographic references you intend to use)
(Explain possible extension to the above models)
(Code / Projects Reports of the previous year)


## Research Methods

%BM-stochastic leaarning model with balancing influence of neighbourhood
%Cellular Automata

(Cellular Automata, Agent-Based Model, Continuous Modeling...) (If you are not sure here: 1. Consult your colleagues, 2. ask the teachers, 3. remember that you can change it afterwards)
